Roadmap

Phase 1

* Get basic CardGameLibary coded and working
* Create unit tests
* Make 1 very basic game that runs by itself
1. Create game with 2 players
2. Deal hand of X cards to each player
3. Each player plays best card
4. Compare cards
5. Loser has to draw or both draw in tie
6. First one out wins
7. Goto 3
* Put on github at this point
* Make basic valid game 2 (something popular and recognizable)
* Use Dependency Injection

Phase 2 ideas

* Create web project
* Create WebAPI wrapper around library
* RESTful services (JSON based)
* Determine persistence and in-memory storage strategy (some in memory objects for game sessions and some persisted entities)
* Display images with the SVG card image library from wikipedia. Looks like it's licensable.
* HTML5
* AngularJS or similar
* SignalR - multiplayer
